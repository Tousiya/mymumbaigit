# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project

This is a self-practice DevOps project that simulates an enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline built using Jenkins, Docker, and other DevOps tools.

## 📌 Objective

To build an automated CI/CD pipeline for a sample Java application, with build, test, artifact management, containerization, and deployment steps.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Jenkins (Multi-branch Pipelines)
- GitHub
- Maven
- SonarQube (Code Quality)
- JFrog Artifactory (Artifact storage)
- Docker (Containerization)
- [Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Helm] *(In Progress)*

## 🔁 Pipeline Stages (Jenkinsfile)

1. **Code Checkout** from GitHub  
2. **Static Code Analysis** with SonarQube  
3. **Build** using Maven  
4. **Publish Artifacts** to JFrog  
5. **Build Docker Image**  
6. *(Optional: Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm)*

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **self-replicated project** created to simulate real-world DevOps practices, not for a live client.
